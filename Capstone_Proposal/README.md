# Machine Learning Engineer - Capstone Project

This repository contains code and associated files for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program - Capstone Project. This project acts as a practice to all the machine learning and software engineer training learned from this program and used to further develop my skill as a Software Engineer.

### Project Objective

The project goal is to build a machine learning predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, etc) as inputs. Based on the input passenger data, the model predicts if the passenger would survive or not in the Titanic sinking ship. Several supervised machine learning algorithms are used to build and improve the model. Additionally, to receive the passenger information, an endpoint is also developed.
